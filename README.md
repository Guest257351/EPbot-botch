::setup

currently you have to manualy install textract for this file to work.
I am working on a built in first time setup
textract is free for 40 days, but after you will need to pay about $100 AUD/ $73 USD
if you can find a way to bypass the trial and get a paid version for free please tell me because that would help alot
textract download: http://www.structurise.com/textract/
code should work after that, if not you downloaded textract to a different directory, either reinstall, or change the settings in the code if you know how

Some antiviruses will alert you if you download code because some code can contain viruses so it is a good idea to check through downloaded code annywhere from the internet before running.

please note that two textfiles will apear on your desktop when you start it, if you dont want them to apear on your desktop change it in the code
do not remove the part in the code that makes textfiles or the code will not work

::instructions

lists can be found in the math folder under mathmatical skills
do not change to another window as it will use your keyboard and mouse to imput answers
sometimes it will get the first question wrong
solves questions in 1-2 seconds
if it is not working you will have to configure the screen coordinates in the code to cover the area of your screen where the math question is
