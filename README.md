# setup

currently you have to manualy install textract for this file to work.
I am working on a built in first time setup.
textract is free for 40 days, but after you will need to pay about $100 AUD/ $73 USD.
if you can find a way to bypass the trial and get a paid version for free please tell me because that would help alot.
textract download: http://www.structurise.com/textract/.
code should work after that, if not you downloaded textract to a different directory, either reinstall, or change the settings in the code if you know how.

# warnings

Some antiviruses will alert you if you download code because some code can contain viruses so it is a good idea to check through downloaded code annywhere from the internet before running.

please note that two text files will apear in a folder in your programdata, if you dont want them to apear here change it in the code.
do not remove the part in the code that makes text files or the code will not work.

#instructions

WARNING! this EP bot only works on EP math lists that are basic operations, it cannot do addition and division at the same time however.
lists can be found in the math folder under mathmatical skills.
do not change to another window as it will use your keyboard and mouse to imput answers.
sometimes it will get the first question wrong.
solves questions in 1-2 seconds.
if it is not working you will have to configure the screen coordinates in the code to cover the area of your screen where the math question is.
you cannot leave this sitng overnight as it still reqiures a human to give it tasks to do.
