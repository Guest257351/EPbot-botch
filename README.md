::setup
currently you have to manualy install textract for this file to work.
I am working on a built in first time setup
textract is free for 40 days, but after you will need to pay about $100 AUD/ $73 USD
if you can find a way to bypass the trial and get a paid version for free please tell me because that would help alot
textract download: http://www.structurise.com/textract/
code should work after that, if not you downloaded textract to a different directory, either reinstall, or change the settings in the code if you know how

Some antiviruses will alert you if you download code because some code can contain viruses so it is a good idea to check through downloaded code annywhere from the internet before running.
